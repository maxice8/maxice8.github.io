            <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Recently i switched to <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> a Linux
distro based on musl libc and busybox with focus on security and being lightweight.</p>
<p>This article will document the process of moving in from Void Linux to Alpine, how
the uniqueness of using busybox for userland tooling was dealt with and how i got
into contributing for it.</p>
<p><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="coming-from">Coming from</h3>
<p>My previous distro was Void Linux, which i used for as long as i contributed to it.</p>
<p>It is a very solid distro, updates are frequent, Repology counts between 86% to 89%
of packages are updated.</p>
<p>The worst part of moving is that there wasn't anything technically wrong with the
distro itself. If i had to pick a distro i knew would work just fine i would pick
Void Linux.</p>
<p>But alas, other factors related to development and contribution sapped my fun out
of contributing and i want to contribute to every distro i use in one way or another.</p>
<p>I picked Void because i wanted to contribute over it, initially over Alpine Linux,
and went to Exherbo for a time and contributed to it. Now i pick Alpine.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="going-to">Going to</h3>
<p>First thing i did was to load up SysrescueCD on my DriveDroid and plug into my
notebook.</p>
<p>I have been using SysrescueCD to install OSes from it with chroot with
no problems for a long time, much before my long stay in Void, i remember installing
Gentoo and Exherbo with it and i was super comfortable.</p>
<p>So i just picked up the Alpine chroot install guide from
<a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installing_Alpine_Linux_in_a_chroot">here</a>. Pretty
simple and straightforward. I did hit a hitch where it failed to load modules when
i first generated the initramfs with mknitfs but i just did the following in the
initramfs rescue environment</p>
<pre style="background-color:#151515;">
<span style="color:#ffb964;">modprobe</span><span style="color:#e8e8d3;"> ext4
</span><span style="color:#ffb964;">mount</span><span style="color:#e8e8d3;"> /dev/sda2 /sysroot
</span><span style="color:#e8e8d3;">exit
</span></pre>
<p>And it continued as usual. I first installed whatever i could that i used from Void Linux
into Alpine, turns out a few packages were missing like <code>zola</code>, <code>wmutils</code>, <code>xidle</code>,
<code>fd</code>, <code>fcount</code>, <code>sx</code> and <code>qimgv</code> among others.</p>
<p>After installing everything i tried setting up my dotfiles only to hit a problem. Busybox's
ln doesn't support the <code>-r</code> flag which sets up a relative symlink. Easy enough i just made
it hardcoded, it is not like this decision will come back to bite me later.</p>
<p>I decided to drop <code>hsetroot</code> entirely and just use <code>bgs</code> for setting my wallpaper, but overall
my scripts had no problem, at least visible, in getting to work with busybox.</p>
<p>One problem was <code>gotop</code> which wasn't available and didn't work with ps from busybox, it was
worked around by installing the <code>procps</code> package.</p>
<p>Another was the lack of the <code>shellcheck</code> package which is behind the clusterfuck
that is Haskell packaging.</p>
<p>Alpine seems very phobic to adding dependencies, so most stuff is compiled without pulseaudio
support, thankfully i don't need much advanced features from pulseaudio for stuff like <code>mpd</code>
so i just installed <code>pulseaudio-alsa</code> and <code>alsa-plugins-pulse</code> to get to work.</p>
<p>Also the <code>fish</code> package was outdated and without maintainer, so i adopted it and updated it.</p>
<p>On the bright side the <code>/bin/sh</code> of Alpine Linux is very similar to the one from Void Linux,
which is <code>dash</code>, while Alpine's is the <code>ash</code> shell from busybox. Which means that all my
scripts that relied purely on POSIX shell features + local worked just fine.</p>
