            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This small post will show all about how this site, which is hosted via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>,
and is for all intents and purposes a blog, is done.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post can also be of help to users that want a similar setup.</p>
<p>Without further ado.</p>
<p><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<p>Just like baking a cake, this site also needs ingredients to be mixed together into the
content you're seeing. Let's run down over some of them.</p>
<h3 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h3>
<p>Certainly the most important ingredient, it is it that provides the hosting for this site,
without the resources from <code>GitHub</code> it would be much more inconvenient for me to set it all
up.</p>
<h3 id="zola">Zola</h3>
<p>You expected <code>jekyll</code> to be your static site engine ? Too bad!</p>
<p>It was me, <strike>dio</strike> <a href="https://www.getzola.org">zola</a>!</p>
<p>Zola is a static site engine like any other, hugo, jekyll, werc, sw, etc, etc.
There wasn't much thought put into it besides:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is available on <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a>.</li>
<li>It seems easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="travis-ci">Travis CI</h3>
<p>Travis CI is a well know <code>Continous Integration</code> service provider, most importantly i picked it
because <a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux</a> uses it extensively to check pull requests from
contributors before merging.</p>
<p>So it felt like safe, familiar ground and just a natural choice. I never had any problems with
it that were just for me, only the rare global slowdown, which is helpfully warned with their
broadcasts feature.</p>
<h3 id="ghp-import">ghp-import</h3>
<p>This is the one i know least about, it just was suggested when i was trying to jam <code>zola</code> into
GitHub Pages. It just worked, after the fair warning that it will nuke your gh-pages branch
or any other branch you point it to completely useless.</p>
<p>It is the one i have the least interaction with, actually i don't have any direct interaction, it
is used solely by Travis CI.</p>
<h3 id="maxice8-github-io">maxice8.github.io</h3>
<p>This is the repo that host the blog source and the finished content you are reading right now.</p>
<p>It extensively has 2 branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>devel -&gt; where i write stuff to</li>
<li>master -&gt; where the final content is pushed and turned into a functional site</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
<p>Now to how we mix all the ingredients into an website!</p>
<h3 id="zola-flow">Zola flow</h3>
<p>I will spare the details of how to actually work with it, which is much better served by their
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/">docs</a> which helped me
get on my feet.</p>
<p>I'm simple, so i simply picked a simple theme called <a href="https://github.com/getzola/even">even</a>,
it was easy to configure, appeared to just work out of the box, and most importantly it fit
the format i want this blog post to have. I write something based on date, publish and done.</p>
<p>There isn't much in the way of workflow, i configured the initial configuration.toml with
the theme i wanted, the syntax highlighting and even theme configuration options.</p>
<p>After the initial setup is done, creating a new blog post is a matter of creating a new
markdown file, filling the front-matter with:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#151515;">
<span style="color:#e8e8d3;">+++
</span><span style="color:#e8e8d3;">title = &quot;TITLE&quot;
</span><span style="color:#e8e8d3;">date = YYYY-MM-DD
</span><span style="color:#e8e8d3;">+++
</span></pre>
<p>And write away! One thing i liked a lot was how nice working with <code>zola</code> was, running
<code>zola serve --port 8080 --interface 0.0.0.0</code> allowed me to just see how my site would
ultimately look and automatically refresh as i saved the markdown file that is the
post being written, and it looks out for file changes so when you save, the site is
refreshed automatically.</p>
<h3 id="travis-ci-flow">Travis CI Flow</h3>
<p>Most of the work is done by it, for the initial setup i had to create a token just for
it with access to pushing to repos, and then went to travis-ci.org and set it to an
environment variable called GH_TOKEN.</p>
<p>This is my .travis.yml file at the time of writing this post.</p>

</span></pre>
<p>It does a few things, it downloads <code>zola</code> and tries to build the site. If it
succeeds it will build the site again and use <code>ghp-import</code> to create a branch
that is pushable, in this case master is being used, and then it is pushed
to the repo.</p>
<p>At the end of the day i just push to devel and the website is regenerated
completely, i can even make fixes to previous posts.</p>
